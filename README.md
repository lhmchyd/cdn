# My Personal DNS Tools - JavaScript & CSS ðŸŽ¨

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
Welcome to my little project, where I tinker with **JavaScript** and **CSS** for DNS. This repository is all about experimenting, learning, and testing ideas related to DNS. It's not meant to be production-readyâ€”just something fun and educational. ðŸ˜Š

---

## ðŸŒŸ What's Inside?

- **Custom JavaScript:**  
  Scripts that handle DNS parsing, validation, or other cool stuff I'm playing with.  

- **Handcrafted CSS:**  
  Some simple styles to make DNS-related interfaces look nice and clean.  

- **Totally Experimental:**  
  These tools are for testing and education onlyâ€”use at your own risk!
